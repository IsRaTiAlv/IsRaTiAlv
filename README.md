- 👋 Hi, My name is Israel. I am a Summa Cum Laude graduated from the Bolivian Catholic University with a BE in Mechatronics. 
Currently, I am part of the computer science team at the Mechatronics research center CIDIMEc. 
Furthermore, I have been working and teaching at Catholic University for more than two years.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision applications using deep learning techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects related with gait recognition.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email](ir.tinini@acad.ucb.edu.bo) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isratial/)
- ✨ My research interests mainly focus on:
  + Individual identification using gait patterns for intelligence surveillance systems.
  + Real-time image segmentation for instance extraction using generative models.
  + Self-driving cars based on imitation learning using an end-to-end approach.
