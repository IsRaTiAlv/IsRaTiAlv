👋 Welcome! my name is Israel. I am machine perception enthusiast with research and industry experience in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Sony in Brussels. 
Previously, I completed a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven with a thesis in collaboration with the European Space Agency. My research interests include: machine perception, models on the edge, and 3D computer vision.
In particular, I would like to explore the use of commodity sensors for democratizing real-time 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.  

As a Software Engineer in the AI & Perception team at the Mobile and Exploration Department in Sony Depthsensing Solutions NV in Brussels-Belgium, I work on the challenging topic of achieving real-time depth completion on edge devices. 
In a nutshell, the objective is to combine RGB data and highly sparse depth information to produce a dense and accurate depth map stream in real-time on a mobile device. 
I am primarily involved in model optimization, implementing of latency-aware structured pruning, designed to jointly optimize for latency and accuracy in TensorFlow.
